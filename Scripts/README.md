# Script Instructions

This repository includes a Python script to generate a new level called **TropicalIsland**.
Run the script inside the Unreal Editor's Python environment:

```python
import Scripts.create_tropical_island as island
island.create_island_level()
```

The script relies on StarterContent assets for the island plane, ocean, and volcano cone.
